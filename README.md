# Lunar-Moon-landing
The objective of the project is to develop an autonomous agent that learns to control a lunar lander spacecraft to safely land on a designated landing pad. This is achieved using **Reinforcement Learning** (RL) algorithms like **Deep Q-Learning** (DQN) or other advanced RL techniques.

The Lunar Lander environment, provided by OpenAI Gym, simulates a two-dimensional world where the agent learns by interacting with the environment and optimizing its behavior through trial and error.
