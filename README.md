# **Project Title**  
**Solving the Lunar Lander Environment Using Reinforcement Learning**

---

## **Project Overview**  
The objective of this project is to develop an autonomous agent capable of controlling a lunar lander spacecraft to land safely on a designated landing pad. This is achieved using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms like **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**.

The **LunarLander-v2** environment from OpenAI Gym is used as a benchmark for training and testing the RL agent.

## **Environment Details**

- **Environment**: OpenAI Gym's `LunarLander-v2`
- **State Space**:  
  8 continuous values representing:  
  - Horizontal and vertical positions (x, y)  
  - Horizontal and vertical velocities (vx, vy)  
  - Angle of the lander and angular velocity  
  - Contact states of the left and right legs  

- **Action Space**:  
  - **Discrete Actions**:  
    - `0`: Do nothing  
    - `1`: Fire the main engine (upward thrust)  
    - `2`: Fire the left engine (rightward thrust)  
    - `3`: Fire the right engine (leftward thrust)  

- **Rewards**:  
  - Landing on the pad: **+200 points** (reward increases with efficiency)  
  - Crashing or flying out of bounds: **-100 points**  
  - Firing engines incurs a **small fuel penalty**

## **Tools and Libraries**

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:

- **OpenAI Gym**: `LunarLander-v2` environment  
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**: Deep learning models for RL  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib**: Visualizing rewards and training progress  
- **Collections/Deque**: Tracking scores and results

## **Reinforcement Learning Methodology**

1. **Initialize the Environment**:  
   Use OpenAI Gym to create the `LunarLander-v2` environment.

2. **Define the Q-Network**:  
   A deep neural network approximates the Q-values for each state-action pair.  
   - **Input**: 8-dimensional state vector.  
   - **Output**: Q-values for 4 possible actions.

3. **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**:  
   Use the epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration (random actions) and exploitation (optimal actions).

4. **Experience Replay**:  
   Store experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer to stabilize training.

5. **Train the Agent**:  
   Train the Q-network using the **Bellman Equation**:  
   \[
   Q(s, a) = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')
   \]  
   where \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.

6. **Track Performance**:  
   Monitor rewards and scores over episodes to evaluate the agent's performance.

7. **Render the Environment**:  
   Use `env.render()` to visualize the agentâ€™s performance in the environment.
